My debut project is a full-featured website of a fictional cafe franchise.

It consists of 5 applications: Cafe, Menu, Cart, Order and Blog apps. 

For back-end purposes I used Python Web framework Django. Front-end is implemented in HTML/CSS and Bootstrap CSS framework.

Subsequent changes / additions are possible.
