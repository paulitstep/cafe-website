<h1>Cafe Website</h1>

My debut project is a <b>full-featured website of a fictional cafe franchise</b>.

It consists of 5 applications: Cafe, Menu, Cart, Order and Blog apps. 

For back-end purposes I used Python Web framework <i>Django</i>. Front-end is implemented in <i>HTML/CSS</i> and <i>Bootstrap</i>
CSS framework.

Subsequent changes / additions are possible.
